# housing-price-vs-supply-2024

We were interested in exploring the relationship between housing prices and supply, to test how well the economic model of supply and demand maps to this real-world example. To that end, our SMART research question is as follows: how is the supply of housing related to average home prices across U.S. metropolitan areas in the year 2024? To answer this question, we will analyze data from the American Enterprise Institute Housing Centerâ€™s State and County Housing Market Indicators: Update for 2024 dataset, found [here](https://www.aei.org/the-state-of-the-housing-market/), specifically looking at the 2024 median housing prices and the number of months it would take for the inventory of homes for sale to be exhausted at the current sales pace. Our dataset will include 9241 metropolitan-area-level observations, giving us a broad picture of how housing supply and prices vary across the country.
