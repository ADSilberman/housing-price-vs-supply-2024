# housing-price-vs-supply-2024

We were interested in exploring the relationship between housing prices and supply, to test how well the economic model of supply and demand maps to this real-world example. To that end, our SMART research question is as follows: how is the supply of housing related to average home prices across U.S. metropolitan areas in the year 2024? To answer this question, we will analyze data from the American Enterprise Institute Housing Center’s Home Price Appreciation Index and Months’ Remaining Inventory, found [here](https://www.aei.org/home-price-appreciation-index-and-months-remaining-inventory/), specifically looking at the number of housing units and average housing prices in 2024. Our dataset will include approximately 49715 metropolitan-area-level observations, giving us a broad picture of how housing supply and prices vary across the country.
